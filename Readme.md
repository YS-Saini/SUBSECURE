## Components

### 1. Smart ID Cards for Mining Workers
- **Battery Life**: 3–4 years  
- **Continuous Broadcasting**: Worker IDs transmitted via BLE in real time  
- **Automated Shift Logging**: Entry/exit detection without manual clocking  

### 2. Static Nodes for Environmental Monitoring
- **Robust Design**: IP69 casing, compact (5×5 cm)  
- **Environmental Sensors**:  
  - Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10)  
  - Temperature & Humidity  
  - Lethal Gas Leaks (e.g., methane)  
- **Data Transmission**: Worker IDs + environmental data sent to ground station  

### 3. Dashboard / Mobile Application
- **Real-Time Worker Tracking**  
- **Environmental Monitoring with Alerts**  
- **Automated Shift Logging**  
- **DGMS Compliance**
